        Resizes an image to fit within a tiled canvas while maintaining its aspect ratio.
        The optimal canvas size is calculated based on the maximum number of tiles and the tile size.

        The function first determines the best tile arrangement for the image, then resizes the image
        to fit within this canvas. The resized image and the number of tiles along the height and width
        dimensions are returned.

                Size of the output image.
            max_image_tiles (`int`):
                The maximum number of tiles to split the image into.
