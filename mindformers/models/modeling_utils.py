        Instantiate a pretrained mindspore model from a pre-trained model configuration.

        The model is set in evaluation mode by default using `model.set_train(False)` (Dropout modules are deactivated).
        To train the model, you should first set it back in training mode with `model.set_train(True)`.

        The warning *Weights from XXX not initialized from pretrained model* means that the weights of XXX do not come
        pretrained with the rest of the model. It is up to you to train those weights with a downstream fine-tuning
        task.

        The warning *Weights from XXX not used in YYY* means that the layer XXX is not used by YYY, therefore those
        weights are discarded.

        Parameters:
            pretrained_model_name_or_path (`str` or `os.PathLike`, *optional*):
                Can be either:

                    - A string, the *model id* of a pretrained model hosted inside a model repo on huggingface.co.
                      Valid model ids can be located at the root-level, like `bert-base-uncased`, or namespaced under a
                      user or organization name, like `dbmdz/bert-base-german-cased`.
                    - A path to a *directory* containing model weights saved using
                      [`~PreTrainedModel.save_pretrained`], e.g., `./my_model_directory/`.
                    - A path or url to a *tensorflow index checkpoint file* (e.g, `./tf_model/model.ckpt.index`). In
                      this case, `from_tf` should be set to `True` and a configuration object should be provided as
                      `config` argument. This loading path is slower than converting the TensorFlow checkpoint in a
                      PyTorch model using the provided conversion scripts and loading the PyTorch model afterwards.
                    - A path or url to a model folder containing a *flax checkpoint file* in *.msgpack* format (e.g,
                      `./flax_model/` containing `flax_model.msgpack`). In this case, `from_flax` should be set to
                      `True`.
                    - `None` if you are both providing the configuration and state dictionary (resp. with keyword
                      arguments `config` and `state_dict`).
            model_args (sequence of positional arguments, *optional*):
                All remaining positional arguments will be passed to the underlying model's `__init__` method.
            config (`Union[PretrainedConfig, str, os.PathLike]`, *optional*):
                Can be either:

                    - an instance of a class derived from [`PretrainedConfig`],
                    - a string or path valid as input to [`~PretrainedConfig.from_pretrained`].

                Configuration for the model to use instead of an automatically loaded configuration. Configuration can
                be automatically loaded when:

                    - The model is a model provided by the library (loaded with the *model id* string of a pretrained
                      model).
                    - The model was saved using [`~PreTrainedModel.save_pretrained`] and is reloaded by supplying the
                      save directory.
                    - The model is loaded by supplying a local directory as `pretrained_model_name_or_path` and a
                      configuration JSON file named *config.json* is found in the directory.
            state_dict (`Dict[str, mindspore.Parameter]`, *optional*):
                A state dictionary to use instead of a state dictionary loaded from saved weights file.

                This option can be used if you want to create a model from a pretrained configuration but load your own
                weights. In this case though, you should check if using [`~PreTrainedModel.save_pretrained`] and
                [`~PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained`] is not a simpler option.
            cache_dir (`Union[str, os.PathLike]`, *optional*):
                Path to a directory in which a downloaded pretrained model configuration should be cached if the
                standard cache should not be used.
            ignore_mismatched_sizes (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
                Whether or not to raise an error if some of the weights from the checkpoint do not have the same size
                as the weights of the model (if for instance, you are instantiating a model with 10 labels from a
                checkpoint with 3 labels).
            force_download (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
                Whether or not to force the (re-)download of the model weights and configuration files, overriding the
                cached versions if they exist.
            resume_download (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
                Whether or not to delete incompletely received files. Will attempt to resume the download if such a
                file exists.
            proxies (`Dict[str, str]`, *optional*):
                A dictionary of proxy servers to use by protocol or endpoint, e.g., `{'http': 'foo.bar:3128',
                'http://hostname': 'foo.bar:4012'}`. The proxies are used on each request.
            output_loading_info(`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
                Whether ot not to also return a dictionary containing missing keys, unexpected keys and error messages.
            local_files_only(`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
                Whether or not to only look at local files (i.e., do not try to download the model).
            token (`str` or `bool`, *optional*):
                The token to use as HTTP bearer authorization for remote files. If `True`, or not specified, will use
                the token generated when running `huggingface-cli login` (stored in `~/.huggingface`).
            revision (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"main"`):
                The specific model version to use. It can be a branch name, a tag name, or a commit id, since we use a
                git-based system for storing models and other artifacts on huggingface.co, so `revision` can be any
                identifier allowed by git.

                <Tip>

                To test a pull request you made on the Hub, you can pass `revision="refs/pr/<pr_number>".

                </Tip>

            subfolder (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `""`):
                In case the relevant files are located inside a subfolder of the model repo on huggingface.co, you can
                specify the folder name here.
            variant (`str`, *optional*):
                If specified load weights from `variant` filename, *e.g.* pytorch_model.<variant>.bin. `variant` is
                ignored when using `from_tf` or `from_flax`.

            kwargs (remaining dictionary of keyword arguments, *optional*):
                Can be used to update the configuration object (after it being loaded) and initiate the model.
                Behaves differently depending on whether a `config` is provided or automatically loaded:

                    - If a configuration is provided with `config`, `**kwargs` will be directly passed to the
                      underlying model's `__init__` method (we assume all relevant updates to the configuration have
                      already been done)
                    - If a configuration is not provided, `kwargs` will be first passed to the configuration class
                      initialization function ([`~PretrainedConfig.from_pretrained`]). Each key of `kwargs` that
                      corresponds to a configuration attribute will be used to override said attribute with the
                      supplied `kwargs` value. Remaining keys that do not correspond to any configuration attribute
                      will be passed to the underlying model's `__init__` function.
