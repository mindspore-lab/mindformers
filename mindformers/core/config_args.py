    Context should be configured before running your program. If there is no configuration,
    it will be automatically set according to the device target by default.

    Note:
        Attribute name is required for setting attributes.
        The mode is not recommended to be changed after net was initialized because the implementations of some
        operations are different in graph mode and pynative mode. Default: ``PYNATIVE_MODE`` .

    Args:
        device_id (int):
            ID of the target device, the value must be in [0, device_num_per_host-1],
            while device_num_per_host should be no more than 4096. Default: ``0`` .
        device_target (str):
            The target device to run, support "Ascend", "GPU", and "CPU".
            If device target is not set, the version of MindSpore package is used.
        max_device_memory (str):
            Set the maximum memory available for devices. The format is "xxGB".
            Default: ``" 1024GB"`` . The actual used memory size is the minimum of the available memory of the device
            and max_device_memory.
        variable_memory_max_size (str):
            This parameter is deprecated, and will be removed in a future version.
            Please use parameter 'max_device_memory' instead.
        mempool_block_size (str):
            Set the size of the memory pool block in PyNative mode for devices.
            The format is "xxGB". Default: ``"1GB"`` . Minimum size is "1G". The actual used memory block size is the
            minimum of the available memory of the device and mempool_block_size.
        op_timeout (int):
            Set the maximum duration of executing an operator in seconds.
            If the execution time exceeds this value, system will terminate the task. 0 means endless wait.
            Default: ``1900`` .
        save_graphs (bool or int):
            Whether to save intermediate compilation graphs. Default: ``0`` .
            Available values are:

            - False or 0: disable saving of intermediate compilation graphs.
            - 1: some intermediate files will be generated during graph compliation.
            - True or 2: Generate more ir files related to backend process.
            - 3: Generate visualization computing graphs and detailed frontend ir graphs.

            When the `save_graphs` attribute is set as ``True`` , ``1`` , ``2`` or ``3`` , attribute of
            `save_graphs_path` is used to set the intermediate compilation graph storage path. By default, the graphs
            are saved in the current directory.
        save_graphs_path (str):
            Path to save graphs. Default: ".".
            If the specified directory does not exist, the system will automatically create the directory.
            During distributed training, graphs will be saved to the directory of
            `save_graphs_path/rank_${rank_id}/`. `rank_id` is the ID of the current device in the cluster.
        deterministic (str):
            Whether to enable op run in deterministic mode. The value must be in the
            range of ['ON', 'OFF'], and the default value is ``'OFF'`` .

            - "ON": Enable operator deterministic running mode.
            - "OFF": Disable operator deterministic running mode.

            When deterministic mode is on, model ops will be deterministic in Ascend. This means that if op run
            multiple times with the same inputs on the same hardware, it will have the exact same outputs each time.
            This is useful for debugging models.
        enable_dump (bool):
            This parameters is deprecated, and will be deleted in the next version.
        save_dump_path (str):
            This parameters is deprecated, and will be deleted in the next version.
        print_file_path (str):
            The path of saving print data. If this parameter is set, print data is saved to
            a file by default, and print_file_path is not set, the screen will be displayed.
            If the saved file already exists, the timestamp suffix will be added to the file. Saving data to a file
            solves the problem of data loss in screen printing when a large amount of data is generated.
            If it is not set, an error will be reported: prompt to set the upper absolute path.
        env_config_path (str): Config path for DFX.
            Through mindspore.set_context(env_config_path="./mindspore_config.json")

            configure RDR:

            - enable: controls whether the RDR is enabled to collect the key data during training and
              save key data in the fault scenario. When set to ``true`` , the RDR will be turned on.
              When set to ``false`` , the RDR will be turned off.
            - mode: sets the mode of RDR on exporting data. When set to ``1`` , the RDR only exports data
              in the fault scenario. When set to ``2`` , the RDR exports data in the fault scenario and the
              normal end scenario. Default: ``1`` .
            - path: sets the path where RDR saves data. The current path must be absolute.

            Memory reuse:

            - mem_Reuse: controls whether the memory reuse function is turned on. When set to ``True`` ,
              the memory reuse function is turned on. When set to ``False`` , the memory reuse function is turned off.

        precompile_only (bool):
            Whether to only precompile the network. Default: ``False`` .
            If set to ``True`` , the network will only be compiled, not executed.
        reserve_class_name_in_scope (bool) :
            Whether to save the network class name in the scope. Default: ``True`` .
            Each node has a scope. A scope of a subnode is the name of its parent node. If reserve_class_name_in_scope
            is set to ``True`` , the class name will be saved after keyword 'net-' in the scope.
            For example:

            Default/net-Net1/net-Net2 (reserve_class_name_in_scope=True)

            Default/net/net (reserve_class_name_in_scope=False)

        pynative_synchronize (bool):
            Whether to enable synchronous execution of the device in PyNative mode.
            Default: ``False`` . When the value is set to ``False`` , the operator is executed asynchronously on the
            device. When an error occurs in the execution of the operator, the specific error script code location
            cannot be located, when the value is set to ``True`` , the operator is executed synchronously on the
            device. It will reduce the execution performance of the program. At this time, when an error occurs in the
            execution of the operator, the location of the error script code can be located according to the call stack
            of the error.
        mode (int):
            Running in GRAPH_MODE(0) or PYNATIVE_MODE(1).
            Both modes support all backends. Default: ``PYNATIVE_MODE`` .
        enable_reduce_precision (bool):
            Whether to enable precision reduction.
            If the operator does not support the user-specified precision, the precision will
            be changed automatically. Default: ``True`` .
        check_bprop (bool):
            Whether to check back propagation nodes. The checking ensures that the shape and dtype
            of back propagation node outputs is the same as input parameters. Default: ``False`` .
        max_call_depth (int):
            Specify the maximum depth of function call. Must be positive integer. Default: ``1000`` .
            The max_call_depth parameter needs to be set when the nested call is too deep or the number
            of subgraphs is too large. If max_call_depth is set larger than before, the system max stack depth should be
            set larger too, otherwise a `core dumped` exception may be raised because of system stack overflow.
        grad_for_scalar (bool):
            Whether to get gradient for scalar. Default: ``False`` .
            When grad_for_scalar is set to ``True`` , the function's scalar input can be derived.
            The default value is ``False`` . Because the back-end does not support scaling operations currently,
            this interface only supports simple operations that can be deduced by the front-end.
        enable_compile_cache (bool):
            Whether to save or load the cache of the graph compiled by front-end.
            After enable_compile_cache is set to ``True`` , during the first execution, a hardware-independent
            compilation cache is generated and exported to a MINDIR file. When the network is executed again,
            if enable_compile_cache is still set to ``True`` and the network scripts are not changed,
            the compile cache is loaded. Note that only limited automatic detection for the changes of
            python scripts is supported by now, which means that there is a correctness risk. Default: ``False`` .
            This is an experimental prototype that is subject to change and/or deletion.
        compile_cache_path (str):
            Path to save the compile cache. Default: ".".
            If the specified directory does not exist, the system will automatically create the directory.
            The cache will be saved to the directory of `compile_cache_path/rank_${rank_id}/`. The `rank_id` is
            the ID of the current device in the cluster.
        inter_op_parallel_num(int):
            The thread number of op parallel at the same time. Default value is ``0`` ,
            which means use the default num.
        runtime_num_threads(int):
            The thread pool number of cpu kernel used in runtime,
            which must bigger than or equal to 0. Default value is ``30`` , if you run many processes at
            the same time, you should set the value smaller to avoid thread contention.
        disable_format_transform (bool):
            Whether to disable the automatic format transform function from NCHW to NHWC.
            When the network training performance of fp16 is worse than fp32, `disable_format_transform` can be set to
            ``True`` to try to improve training performance. Default: ``False`` .
        support_binary (bool):
            Whether to support run .pyc or .so in graph mode. If want to support run .so or .pyc
            in graph mode, coulde set 'support_binary' to be ``True`` , and run once .py file. It would save the source
            of the interfaces would be compiled by MindSpore to the interfaces definition .py file that should be
            guaranteed to be writable. Then compile the .py file to the .pyc or .so file, and could run in Graph mode.
        memory_optimize_level (str):
            The memory optimize level.
            Default: O0. The value must be in ['O0', 'O1'].

            - O0: priority performance option, disable SOMAS (Safe Optimized Memory Allocation Solver).
            - O1: priority memory option, enable SOMAS.
        memory_offload (str):
            Whether to enable the memory offload function. When it is enabled, the idle data will be
            temporarily copied to the host side in the case of insufficient device memory. The value must be in the
            range of ['ON', 'OFF'], and the default value is ``'OFF'`` .

        Setting or changing parallel modes must be called before creating any Initializer, otherwise,
        it may have RuntimeError when compiling the network.

            "stand_alone" do not support gradients_mean. Default: ``False`` .
        gradient_fp32_sync (bool):
            Run allreduce of gradients in fp32. "stand_alone", "data_parallel"
            and "hybrid_parallel" do not support gradient_fp32_sync. Default: ``True`` .
        parallel_mode (str):
            There are five kinds of parallel modes, ``"stand_alone"`` , ``"data_parallel"`` ,
            ``"hybrid_parallel"`` , ``"semi_auto_parallel"`` and ``"auto_parallel"`` . Note the pynative mode
            only supports the ``"stand_alone"`` and ``"data_parallel"`` mode. Default: ``"stand_alone"`` .

                 - stand_alone: Only one processor is working.

                 - recursive_programming: Recursive programming search mode. In order to obtain optimal performance,
                   it is recommended that users set the batch size to be greater than or equal to the product of

            for forward compatibility, and this attribute will be deleted in a future MindSpore version.
        parameter_broadcast (bool):
            Whether to broadcast parameters before training. Before training, in order to have
            the same network initialization parameter values for all devices, broadcast the parameters
            on device 0 to other devices. Parameter broadcasting in different parallel modes is different,
            ``data_parallel`` mode, all parameters are broadcast except for the parameter whose attribute
            layerwise_parallel is ``True`` . ``Hybrid_parallel`` , ``semi_auto_parallel``  and

        strategy_ckpt_load_file (str): The path to load parallel strategy checkpoint. The parameter is not to be
                       recommended currently, it is better using 'strategy_ckpt_config' to replace it. Default: ``''``
        strategy_ckpt_save_file (str): The path to save parallel strategy checkpoint. The parameter is not to be
                       recommended currently, it is better using 'strategy_ckpt_config' to replace it. Default: ``''``
        full_batch (bool): If you load whole batch datasets in ``auto_parallel`` mode, this parameter
                       should be set as ``True`` . Default: ``False`` . The interface is not to be recommended
                       currently, it is better using 'dataset_strategy' to replace it.

                       dataset_strategy="data_parallel" is equal to full_batch=False, dataset_strategy="full_batch" is
                       equal to full_batch=True. For execution mode is 'GRAPH_MODE' and dataset load into net by model
                       parallel strategy likes ds_stra ((1, 8), (1, 8)), it requires using
                       set_auto_parallel_context(dataset_strategy=ds_stra).
        enable_parallel_optimizer (bool): This is a developing feature, which shards the weight update computation for
                       data parallel training in the benefit of time and memory saving. Currently, auto and semi auto
                       parallel mode support all optimizers in both Ascend and GPU. Data parallel mode only supports
                       `Lamb` and `AdamWeightDecay` in Ascend . Default: ``False`` .
        enable_alltoall (bool): A switch that allows AllToAll operators to be generated during communication. If its
                        value is ``False`` , there will be a combination of operators such as AllGather, Split and
                        Concat instead of AllToAll. Default: ``False`` .
        all_reduce_fusion_config (list): Set allreduce fusion strategy by parameters indices. Only support ReduceOp.SUM

        pipeline_stages (int): Set the stage information for pipeline parallel. This indicates how the devices are
                        distributed alone in the pipeline. The total devices will be divided into 'pipeline_stags'
                        stages. Default: ``1`` .
        grad_accumulation_step (int): This interface is deprecated. Default: ``1`` .
        parallel_optimizer_config (dict):
            A dict contains the keys and values for setting the parallel optimizerconfigure.

            when parallel optimizer is enabled. Currently it supports the key `gradient_accumulation_shard`.
            The configure will be effective when we use
            mindspore.set_auto_parallel_context(enable_parallel_optimizer=True).
            It supports the following keys.

                - gradient_accumulation_shard(bool): If ``true`` , the accumulation gradient parameters will be
                  sharded across the data parallel devices.
                  This will introduce additional communication(ReduceScatter)
                  at each step when accumulate the gradients,
                  but saves a lot of device memories, thus can make model be trained with larger batch size.
                  This configure is effective only when the model runs on pipeline training or gradient
                  accumulation with data parallel. Default ``False`` .

                - parallel_optimizer_threshold(int): Set the threshold of parallel optimizer. When parallel
                  optimizer is enabled, parameters with size smaller than this threshold will not be sharded
                  across the devices. Parameter size = shape[0] * ... * shape[n] * size(dtype). Non-negative.
                  Unit: KB. Default: ``64`` .

        comm_fusion (dict):
            A dict contains the types and configurations for setting the communication fusion.
            Each communication fusion config has two keys: "mode" and "config".
            It supports following communication fusion types and configurations:

                - openstate: Whether turn on the communication fusion or not. If `openstate` is ``True`` ,
                  turn on the communication fusion, otherwise, turn off the communication fusion.
                  Default: ``True`` .

                - allreduce: If communication fusion type is `allreduce`. The `mode` contains: `auto`, `size`
                  and `index`. In `auto` mode, AllReduce fusion is configured by gradients size and the default
                  fusion threshold is `64` MB. In 'size' mode, AllReduce fusion is configured by gradients size
                  manually, and the fusion threshold must be larger than `0` MB. In `index` mode, it is same as
                  `all_reduce_fusion_config`.

                - allgather: If communication fusion type is `allgather`. The `mode` contains: `auto`, `size`.
                  In `auto` mode, AllGather fusion is configured by gradients size, and the default fusion
                  threshold is `64` MB. In 'size' mode, AllGather fusion is configured by gradients size
                  manually, and the fusion threshold must be larger than `0` MB.

                - reducescatter: If communication fusion type is `reducescatter`. The `mode` contains: `auto`
                  and `size`. Config is same as `allgather`.

        strategy_ckpt_config (dict):
            A dict contains the configurations for setting the parallel strategy file.
            This interface contains the functions of parameter `strategy_ckpt_load_file` and
            `strategy_ckpt_save_file`, it is recommonded to use this parameter to replace those two
            parameters. It contains following configurations:

                - load_file (str): The path to load parallel strategy checkpoint. If the file name extension is
                  `.json`, the file is loaded in JSON format. Otherwise, the file is loaded in ProtoBuf
                  format.
                  Default: ''

                - save_file (str): The path to save parallel strategy checkpoint. If the file name extension is
                  `.json`, the file is saved in JSON format. Otherwise, the file is saved in ProtoBuf format.
                  Default: ''

                - only_trainable_params (bool): Only save/load the strategy information for trainable parameter.
                  Default: ``True`` .

    Raises:
        ValueError: If input key is not attribute in auto parallel context.
